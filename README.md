# Focused-AI-SGD-SISSO-acetylene-hydrogenation

This repository contains supporting information related to the publication "Modeling Time-On-Stream Catalyst Reactivity in the Selective Hydrogenation of Concentrated Acetylene Streams Under Industrial Conditions via Experiments and AI", available at https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/67ea84986dde43c908d79032.

The "data" folder contains the datasets used in the publication. The "output" folder contains the output files of subgroup discovery and SISSO that were used to obtain the results of the publication.

The "notebook.ipynb" jupyter notebook generates the input files of subgroup discovery and SISSO and analyzes the results. This notebook can be used to generate the figures of the publication and it can be modified to produce new analyses.
